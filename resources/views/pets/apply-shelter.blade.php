    <p>Hey there! It looks like only registered shelters can list pets for adoption right now. No worries though if you're a shelter or want to become one, we would love to have you join our community!</p>
    <p>Just apply below, and we will guide you through the process with a warm welcome. It is super easy, and we are excited to support you in finding loving homes for pets!</p>
